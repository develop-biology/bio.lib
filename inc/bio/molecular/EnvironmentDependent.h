/**
 * An EnvironmentDependent object is one that changes how it behaves based on where it exists.
 * This class assumes there is only ever 1 greater environment directly above the inheriting class.
 * For example, a Protein is dependent on the Cell in which it resides and a Cell is dependent on the Tissue in which it resides. However, no where is a Protein dependent on multiple Cells directly nor is any Cell dependent on more than 1 Tissue at a time. Instead, these EnvironmentDependent classes rely on their greater context to move between themselves and further contexts, whatever resources they need or produce. In other words, the immediate m_environment is a pivot point into the larger system & the larger system is often tiered, having an even larger system "above" it.
 * @tparam T what *this is dependent on (will store a T* as m_environment).
