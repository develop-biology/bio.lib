 * Vesicles define an inside / outside dichotomy between the Molecules on the "outside" of *this and the Molecules on the inside of *this.
 * NOTE: The Molecules inside *this can, themselves, be Vesicles (thought they don't have to be).
 * Another way to think of Vesicles is as a "vacuum" whereby Molecules can exist in an isolated context (which is probably not true of any real system). For example think of 1 Molecules on one side of a room and another on the other side; the Vesicle would be the Room and what is ultimately responsible for defining the scale by which the Molecule's separation can be measured.
