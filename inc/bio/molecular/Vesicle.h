/**
 * Vesicles define an inside / outside dichotomy between the Surfaces on the "outside" of *this and the Molecules on the inside of *this. <br />
 * NOTE: The Molecules inside *this can, themselves, be Vesicles (thought they don't have to be). <br />
 * Another way to think of Vesicles is as a "vacuum" whereby Molecules can exist in an isolated context. <br />
 * For example think of one Molecule on one side of a room and another on the other side; the Vesicle would be the room and what is ultimately responsible for defining the scale by which the Molecule's separation can be measured. <br />
 * Functionally, what Vesicle does is implement the "protected" keyword. <br />
 * Thus, Vesicles may only interact with each other through what they expose on their Surfaces. <br />
