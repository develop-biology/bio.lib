/**
 * Vesicles define an inside / outside dichotomy between the Surfaces on the "outside" of *this and the Solutes (likely all Molecules) on the inside of *this. <br />
 * NOTE: The Molecules inside *this can, themselves, be Vesicles (though they don't have to be). <br />
 * <br />
 * Functionally, what Vesicle does is implement the "protected" keyword by using chemical::Solution mechanics. <br />
 * Thus, Vesicles may only interact with each other through what they expose on their Surfaces. <br />
 * <br />
 * Another way to think of Vesicles is as a "vacuum" whereby Molecules can exist in an isolated context. <br />
 * For example think of one Molecule on one side of a room and another on the other side; the Vesicle would be the room, and what is ultimately responsible for defining the scale by which the Molecule's separation can be measured. <br />
 * Furthermore, in a real-world Solution, such as water, some of the H2O molecules may decompose into H+ and OH-, forming small alkaline and acidic pockets which later combine back into neutral H2O. Small differences like this are natural and expected within a homogeneous Solution. We can thus quantify homogeneity as the inability to discern, probabilistically, the location of a significantly varied region, like a small cluster of H+ ions. Once we can say that a varied region is more likely to be in one place or another, we start to define a new Solution. For example, if all H2O molecules split and move to H+ on one side of a container and OH- on the other, we can say that we have one Solution of H+ and a separate Solution of OH-. This is another definition of Vesicle: a space which has a probability of containing some Solute which is different from the surrounding spaces. In our water example, the Vesicle has no hydrophobic encapsulation (as is typical in the real-world definition of "vesicle") and is instead simply an invisible line drawn between the H+ and OH-. This highlights the variability in Surfaces a Vesicle may have: completely transparent or completely opaque, both with nearly no Surface, or some highly specific opacity with a rich ecosystem of Surfaces. <br />
 * <br />
 * Based on the above description, there is no need to use a Solution anywhere in your code. This is true. Don't use Solutions when you can use Vesicles.
