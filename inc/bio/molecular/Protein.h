 * Please read the documentation for Molecule.h to understand how Proteins can best be used.
 * In short, Proteins provide functions for the Biology programming syntax.
 * Proteins are Molecules and can be stored inside Surfaces. This means they will work with Define<Protein>("MyFunction", *myProtein).
 * Proteins can thus be Transferred, reflected, and treated as any other Molecule, chemical::Substance, physical::Wave, etc.
 * NOTE: Because Proteins are Molecules, they are more than just simple functors; they can store variables, facilitate in Transferring variables, and act as any other data structure.
