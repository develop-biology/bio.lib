/**
 * DNA allows Proteins to be stored as variables and be Transcribed and Translated later.
 * In order to improve debugging, Proteins store a pointer to their encoding DNA (similar to how a RISC-like mechanism might identify similar mRNA to that with produced the Protein in order to down-regulate its production; for more info, look into RNA Interference).
 * Because Proteins will point back to their parent DNA, we also provide a name and version for each DNA Molecule. This helps to identify Proteins that might be otherwise indistinguishable.
 * NOTE: genetic/Gene.h has most of the DNA implementation.
 *
 * Also note that, in reality, a single allele (Protein*) may result in the production of multiple proteins. That is true here as well; however, that logic is abstracted to a Protein's sub-proteins.
 * In other words if you want 1 DNA Molecule to produce several Proteins, you must Add<Protein*>() those to the Protein in *this.
