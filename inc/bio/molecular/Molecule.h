/**
 * As a combination of relativistic Waves and chemical Bonds, Molecules are rather complicated. They're kinda like viewing particle physics from mathematical topology.
 * I'm not sure I have the english words to describe this view of the world adequately, so looking at the code might be better.
 * Still, I'll try to describe the idea as an imagination exercise:
 *
 * Imagine a Quantum Wave (aka a built-in type, like bool or int) as a sphere. These quantum balls are the maximum resolution we can see any Molecule through (it doesn't get any more basic than built-in types).
 * Next, imagine a collection of these spheres as some kind of glob. This represents a collection of basic types and would be akin to a class or struct. However, these globs can take whatever form we want and do not have to map into any hard-coded structure. We call these globular constructs a Surface.
 * Most of the time, Surfaces will be singular globs, with a 1 to 1 Surface to primitive type correspondence. However, they can be arbitrarily knobby.
 * Now imagine 10 or so of these Surfaces all stuck together as a Molecule. So, a Molecule is just a big globby mass.
 * Surfaces do not (usually) overlap. They are, instead,  distinct, identifiable (Identifiable<StandardDimension>) regions on a Molecule.
 * Imagine 2 Molecule that have 1 globby collection (Surface) changed. That kind of comparative difference helps us Identify the Surfaces from the otherwise indistinguishable mass of globs.
 * Next, imagine 2 Molecules bumping into each other so that 1 or more of their Surfaces touch.
 * When Surfaces interact in this manner, they can change each other. In computer science, we can just conjure change whenever, however, and wherever we want. However, in the real world, the idea that matter is conserved (which may or may not be true) requires that matter / energy be moved between the interacting surfaces in order to effect change.
 * This same concept has been modeled here; though we can still do whatever the **** we want cause computers.
 *
 * You can create Surfaces in 1 Molecule and then Transfer them to another. However, doing so may change (or break) the Molecules' interactions with other Molecules and systems. This would be like transferring variables between objects at runtime.
 * This Transfer system is why Molecules are Perspectives. The Id of Surfaces in 1 Molecule may not hold within another Molecule and we don't want to enforce a global Surface labeling at this time.
 *
 * The ability to Transfer Surfaces between Molecules is just one advantage that comes from this member abstraction. Another advantage is Symmetry (i.e. reflection into other languages, like json). See Symmetrical.h for more info.
 *
 * Lastly, Surfaces also give us the ability to store methods via Proteins. See Protein.h for more on that.
 *
 * In order realize the behavior described above, we have to employ a non-native, Biology-specific syntax. In short, Define<>() creates a member and RotateTo gets a member.
 * For example:
 * MyType myVar = SomeFunction(); => Define<MyType>("myVar", SomeFunction());
 * MyType another = myVar; => Define<MyType>("another", RotateTo("myVar"));
 * Of course, in order to avoid slower string lookups, you can cache the Id of "myVar" within a Molecule by calling GetIdFromName("myVar"), which can then be used with RotateTo(...).
 *
 * You can think of members as globs on the surface of our Molecule and we spin the Molecule around until the side we want is facing us in order to interact with a Surface.
 * In order to set a member, you would do something like:
 * RotateTo("myVar")->operator=(*RotateTo("another"));
 * or, more simply,
 * (*RotateTo("myVar")) = (*RotateTo("another"))
 * NOTE: if "myVar" or "another" don't exist in the Molecule, this will segfault. To avoid crashing, you may want to use BIO_SANITIZE() (from bio/common/Macros.h)
 * This can be done because Surfaces can be treated as the values they are Bonded to.
 *
 * Lastly, if you want to create a Molecule from a hard-coded data structure, you can call Use() instead of Define<>(), which will create a Surface from a (member) pointer. Surfaces created with Use will not be Transferable.
