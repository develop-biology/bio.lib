/**
 * A Pathway is a series chemical::Reactions that accomplishes some larger goal.
 * Pathways, are themselves Reactions and can be invoked using the same calls (e.g. chemical::Reaction::Initiate<MyPathway>.
 * NOTE: in real life, pathways often include protein-catalyzed reactions. You can do that here too!
 *
 * NOTE: while Pathways are Reactions, they should not have any Requirements / Reactants nor should they perform any Process of their own. Instead, they should rely entirely on the Reactions added to them.
 * With the above stated, Pathways can be treated like Reactions for the purpose of being added to other Pathways ;)
 *
 * Pathways are First-In-First-Out (FIFO) ordered.
 * The first call to Add<Reaction*>() will be the first Reaction run by *this and the Reaction that determines the required Reactants to even begin *this Process.
 * The last call to Add<Reaction*>() will be the last Reaction called and will determine the ultimate Products returned by *this Process, should it successfully run to completion.
 * i.e. return last(middle(first(reactants)));
 *
 * TODO: Add switching logic for Products Code.
