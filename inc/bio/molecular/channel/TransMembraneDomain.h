/**
 * TransMembraneDomains define the API for accessing and modifying the interior, protected Molecules of Vesicles. <br />
 * The real-world term, "trans-membrane domain", is a little more specific than how we use it here. <br />
 * In the simplest case, a TransMembraneDomain is just an "open hole" in a Vesicle's "membrane". <br />
 * In the most complex case, a single TransMembraneDomain may do the work of many different proteins: similar to how we might refer to a complex quaternary structure as a single protein.<br />
 * Regardless of the complexity of use, a TransMembraneDomain is strictly defined as the interface between the inside and outside of a Vesicle. <br />
 * When defining how a Vesicle should communicate with the outside world or other Vesicles, please create a Pore or similar Surface which includes a TransMembraneDomain. <br />
 * Because friendship does not respect inheritance, this class is non-virtual. This is the ONLY API for defining access to protected Molecules. <br />
