/**
 * Pores are simply Surfaces with TransMembraneDomains. <br />
 * The role of a Pore is to facilitate, restrict, and / or monitor the transfer of Molecules in and out of Vesicles. <br />
 * In programming terms, Pores define APIs, where the program is the protected Vesicle contents and the application is the environment or another Vesicle interacting with the contents through a Pore: micro-APIs, if you will. <br />
 * It is up to you to define how you'd like to wrap the methods provided by TransMembraneDomain. <br />
 * See OpenChannel for a simple implementation. <br />
 * NOTE: we use "channel" to designate a Pore implementation and "pore" to designate an abstract, "disarmed" class. <br />
 * Channels "run on" Pores the way sockets "run on" ports; though here Pores scale precisely with Channels. <br />
