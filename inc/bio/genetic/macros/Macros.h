 * To make defining LocalizationSites easier, use this macro to define the function body of your LocalizationSite Function().
 * This will assign a value to a string that is identical to your FunctionName e.g. LocalizationSitePerspective::Instance().GetNameFromId(Value()) would give "Value".
 * This will also help you define the required extraction method (chemical::Excitation*) required for accessing your LocalizationSite.
 * REMINDER: Your LocalizationSite Function()s should be in the ::bio::localization_site namespace.
