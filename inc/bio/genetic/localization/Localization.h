/**
 * Localizations are a chain of named places.
 * Each place is a different Localization, which has more places (Localizations) around it.
 * This system allows us to traverse arbitrarily complex spaces with ease.
 *
 * In order to use a standard interface with arbitrarily complex containers, we rely on physical::Perspective::AssociateType(), chemical::Excitation, and the chemical/structure system to provide us with a means of translating a LocalizationSite (AssociateType) into a class method (Excitation) that is used to query a container by Name (structure).
 * See genetic/Macros.h for an easy way to define all that (its not nearly as hard to use as it is to implement).
 *
 * To create a localization, first select the kind of place you want from the available LocalizationTypes (in the localization_type namespace).
 * Next, note the Name of the desired place.
 * And, lastly, instantiate a Localization.
 * If you would like to identify a place within another place, simple repeat and set the containing Localization as the m_previous of the first.
 * For example, if you want to identify where the bathroom is within a restaurant, we would start with a Localization like {localization_site::Room(), "Bathroom"}, which might cause us to ask the nearest person for the "Bathroom". Next, we would create another Localization along the lines of {localization_site::StreetAddress(), "MyFavoriteRestaurant"}. In this case, StreetAddress would tell us to use a navigation app and maybe a car or taxi service to "extract" the restaurant form the world. Thus, we end up with all the information necessary to "extract" the "Bathroom" from "MyFavoriteRestaurant".
