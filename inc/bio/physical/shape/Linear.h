/**
 * Linear is a ____pointer interface for Biology. <br />
 *
 * This class is used by Line and chemical::LinearMotifs, see those classes for more info. <br />
 *
 * Lines contain logic for handling their CONTENT_TYPE by Id, Name, and other aspects innate to the Identifiable<StandardDimension>. The term "linear" comes from the idea that instead of a 0 dimensional pile of objects, as are Arrangements, *this can be ordered along at least 1 dimension (i.e. the StandardDimension). <br />
 *
 * Current features: <br />
 * 1. Shared: determines whether or not mComponent will be deleted with *this. <br />
 *
 * Future features: <br />
 * 1. Const: determines whether or not *this can be changed. <br />
 *
 * NOTE: Linear is NOT VIRTUAL! <br />
 * This is done to save space in lists. Because we do not need a vtable, we shan't have one! <br />
 *
 * NOTE: we should support Dimensions other than the StandardDimension. However, the limitations of chemical::Atom::Bonds prevent us from indexing more than 1 template variable from ____Interfaces (e.g. Structure). <br />
 * StandardDimension here, mirrors what is used by chemical::Class and does not require any additional template specialization. <br />
 * Plus, not supporting other Dimensions makes for cleaner inheritance / downstream code. <br />
 * Support for other Dimensions may be added in a future release. <br />
