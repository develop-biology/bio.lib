/**
 * Arrangement exists as a base class to templated Arrangements.
 * Essentially we need a generic, non-template std::vector<> base class, so we'll make our own.
 *
 * You can think of Arrangements as our own internal RAM.
 * We allocated a block of bytes and manipulate them as necessary.
 * By default, we use ByteStreams to store arbitrary data in our allocated memory.
 * ByteStreams can be wasteful though (e.g. a whole extra std::string for every Index); so, overrides of *this can use the same internal memory block but store other data structures for more efficient memory usage.
 * We maintain ByteStreams as our data conversion type, as they are flexible but safer than a void*.
 *
 * When using Arrangements, we make no guarantees regarding the type of data stored.
 * All we provide is a consistent means of accessing those data. To this end, we ensure that a Index's validity follows the lifecycle of the datum at that Index. This is identical to pointers: a Index represents the memory address of what is stored in *this. This means that as data are erased from *this, the memory is not moved, consolidated, or manipulated in any way that destroys the old references.
 *
 * When using an Iterator, you will be given a SmartIterator which dynamically determines its implementation. Thus, we allow for full inheritance of *this base class.
 *
 * There is another tradeoff here that we are leaning into: our implementation does not make for easy use of std:: containers under-the-hood. By enforcing consistency on access, we've made the system less flexible. This may be changed in a major release down the road but its what we're sticking with for now.
