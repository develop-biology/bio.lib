/**
 * What a single "point" in space contains. <br />
 * Branes are taken from super string theory and are the multi-dimensional abstraction of membranes. <br />
 * Because multiple types can share names (e.g. int myVar vs float myVar), each Brane must only contain data common to all "points" in the DIMENSION they inhabit (see relativity/Perspective.h for DIMENSION definition). <br />
 * Children of Perspective<> may extend Brane to fill more "complex" DIMENSIONS (all DIMENSIONS are simple numbers but that says nothing about what each number means). <br />
 * <br />
 * For something to exist within a Dimension, as we define it, the thing must: <br />
 * 1. be of lower dimension than the space its found in (this is true by definition and thus ignored). <br />
 * 2. be locatable within that dimension, i.e. take up space. <br />
 * 3. consist of some substance, have some effect, or have the potential to affect and does not simply take up space. <br />
 * Branes must be locatable by a single id for a 1 dimensional array, 2 for a 2 dimensional array and so on. For a Brane to require 2 indices and exist within a 1 dimensional array is a logic error. <br />
 * At a minimum, a Brane must have an id to locate it and something else. We have made that something else a user-friendly(ier) string. All other Branes will have an id and a name and may have other contents as well. <br />
