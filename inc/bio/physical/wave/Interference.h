/**
 * Interference represents the strategy for combining 2 (or more) Waves. <br />
 * Because Waves do not have a concept of physical separation, their point of incidence (where they are Superpose()ed) does not have any bearing on the properties of the Waves (e.g. phase or angle), as it would in reality. Thus, the role of Interference is to determine what those properties should be and how the 2+ Waves should combine. <br />
 * For example, Interference could cause one Wave to cancel out another by setting the first to 0 or false; this would be like destructive interference. Another Interference could cause the same 2 Waves to add together, like constructive interference. <br />
 * To accommodate Waves of arbitrary complexity (i.e. the number of Wave components), Interference can be recursive. <br />
 * When accessing the Superposition of a given Symmetry, the Wave Superposing others may choose to also access the sub-interference for that Symmetry. This is done on a case-by-case basis, according to the implementation of Superpose. <br />
 * Here, Symmetries can be thought of as Wave components. <br />
