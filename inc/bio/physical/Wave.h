/**
 * A Wave is a base class for all Biology objects. <br />
 * Waves can be Periodic but do not have to be. By default, we assume Waves have no discernible frequency, amplitude, or any other Property. This is similar to a chaotic pattern or a wave modulated and/or superposed with enough signals that it becomes indiscernible from white noise / randomness. <br />
 * We cannot make any assumptions about the ordering nor pattern of a Wave at this level. Such Properties will only manifest in derived classes. <br />
 * <br />
 * You should be able to upcast to Wave from any other class. <br />
 * Cloning a Wave should produce a functional fully derived class. This means that all diamond inheritance should be resolved by all children when calling Clone <br />
 * For downcasting to a derived class, you will need to use the chemical::Atom::Bond(...) methodology. See chemical/Atom.h for more info. <br />
 * <br />
 * Waves may be Superposed upon one another. Doing so allows them to affect each other according to their Interference pattern. <br />
 * <br />
 * Waves may be Modulated to store additional signals and subsequently Demodulated in order to retrieve that original signal. In this way, any Wave can carry any other. <br />
 * <br />
 * Waves may be Attenuated and Disattenuated by other Waves as they move through them. Treating Waves as media in this manner is highly implementation dependent. See Atom.h for an example of Attenuation & Disattenuation.<br />

	 * Spinning a Wave produces a Symmetry. Waves can be Rotated about any number of Axes. <br />
	 * Spinning a Wave along one dimension (one Axis) would be the equivalent of reflecting that Wave or, possibly, refracting, dispersing, or otherwise altering the wave (e.g. if the Axis acted like a prism, rather than a mirror). When a Wave is Spun around multiple dimensions, the resulting Symmetry and effected transformations may not fall under any single property characteristic of real waves. Thus we treat Waves more like particles with a discrete spin. <br />
	 *
	 * You can visualize this by imagining a triangle that is then folded over to produce a polygon. Reflecting a triangle about 1 axis generates a rectangle, 2 a square, 3 a hexagon, 4 an octagon, and so on (sides = 3 + fibonacci sequence, starting at 0). Though, in this system, Axes do not overlap, so 1/2 of the polygon is discarded, once n >= 2. In this way, Spin() generates a triangle and you decide the shape by specifying how many Axes to Rotate the Symmetry about. <br />
