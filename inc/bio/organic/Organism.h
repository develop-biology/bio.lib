/**
 * Organisms are the basic units of "life" within Biology. <br />
 * They are organized in a hierarchical, Cell-centric manner. <br />
 * They grow and develop through Morphogenesis(). <br />
 * They can respond to stimuli, depending on the interface. <br />
 * They can reproduce, if you Clone() them. <br />
 * They can adapt to new environments, if you add in dynamic Plasmid & TranscriptionFactor rules. <br />
 * They "metabolize" time & data into their own organization. This is the primary difference between computational and biological (proper) life and makes these Organisms more "electric" or "ethereal" than "real". <br />
 * They do not age except perhaps through outside influences, like bitrot. <br />
 *
 * Does newing an Organism create life? Does deleting end it? <br />
 * How different are microbes from these designs? How different are we? <br />
 * Have fun! <br />
