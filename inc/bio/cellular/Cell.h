/**
 * A Cell is the basic unit of function-driven organization within Biology. <br />
 * Cells use Proteins & Organelles to accomplish tasks. You can think of each Protein as a stand-in for a class method except, instead of hard-coding your classes, you instead code in (hard or soft) the TranscriptionFactors and Plasmids present in a Cell. The Cell then determines its functionality at runtime. <br />
 *
 * In order to simplify the arbitrarily complex behavior that a Cell can perform, Cells are made to Crest, allowing their main function to be called on a clock at a regular interval. <br />
 * Programming a Cell this way is similar to programming an Arduino with a main loop. <br />
 * Of course, you are allowed to modify this behavior in any way you'd like ;) <br />
