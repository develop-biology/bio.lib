/**
 * A Cell is the basic unit of function-driven organization within Biology.
 * Cells use Proteins to accomplish tasks. You can think of each Protein as a stand-in for a class method except, instead of hard-coding your classes, you instead code in (hard or soft) the TranscriptionFactors and Plasmids present in a Cell. The Cell then determines its functionality at runtime.
 * NOTE: While Cells are Vesicles, they do not register with the VesiclePerspective; instead, they can be Identifiable by the CellPerspective.
 *
 * In order to simplify the arbitrarily complex behavior that a Cell can perform, Cells are made to Peak, allowing their main function to be called on a clock at a regular interval.
 * Programming a Cell this way is similar to programming an Arduino.
 * Of course, you are allowed to modify this behavior in any way you'd like ;)
