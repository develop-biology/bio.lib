/**
 * An Organ is a collection of Tissues that can operate on its own. <br />
 * Similar to how Plasmids are packages of Genes, Organs are packages of Tissues. <br />
 * In this way, Organs are like pseudo-binaries that can be integrated into other binaries. <br />
 *
 * Organs contain all of the DNA (Plasmids) they need to create all of their Cells. <br />
 * This means you should new the Plasmids necessary for your Organ within the BuildMobilome method. <br />
 *
 * Once your Organ is prepared, you can initialize it with SpecializeTissues() and run it with Crest. However, these will be done for you through the parent OrganSystem. <br />
