/**
 * Containers are the singular Biology container construct. <br />
 * Essentially we need a generic, non-template ::std::vector<> base class, so we'll make our own. <br />
 * Different containers (e.g. the corollaries to ::std::set vs ::std::map vs ::std::vector) are all children of *this and we use typical inheritance to modify the behavior of each specialization. <br />
 * By using inheritance for our Containers, we can pass Container*s around and use a standard interface to manipulate the contents. In other words, we can treat ::std::sets like ::std::vectors or even treat ::std::maps like ::std::queues, all by overriding virtual methods and handling inputs consistently (obviously containers with key value pairs will need to pull a new piece of information from somewhere if given only a key or only a value). <br />
 *  <br />
 * NOTE: we still use stl containers where the additional features of *this class are not needed. Those usages may be changed to implement *this in a future release. <br />
 *
 * You can think of Containers as our own internal RAM. <br />
 * We allocated a block of bytes and manipulate them as necessary. <br />
 * By default, we use ByteStreams to store arbitrary data in our allocated memory. <br />
 * ByteStreams can be wasteful though (e.g. a whole extra ::std::string for every Index); so, overrides of *this can use the same internal memory block but store other data structures for more efficient memory usage. <br />
 * We maintain ByteStreams as our data conversion type, as they are flexible but safer than a void*. <br />
 *
 * When using Containers, we make no guarantees regarding the type of data stored. <br />
 * All we provide is a consistent means of accessing those data. To this end, we ensure that a Index's validity follows the lifecycle of the datum at that Index. This is identical to pointers: a Index represents the memory address of what is stored in *this. This means that as data are erased from *this, the memory is not moved, consolidated, or manipulated in any way that destroys the old references. <br />
 * This rule does have some exceptions and you are allowed to break it yourself. However, we try to stick by this as much as possible (e.g. see Insert(), below). <br />
 *
 * When using an Iterator, you will be given a SmartIterator which dynamically determines its implementation. Thus, we allow for full inheritance of *this base class. <br />
 *
 * There is another tradeoff here that we are leaning into: our interface does not make for easy use of ::std:: containers under-the-hood. By enforcing consistency on access, we've made the system less flexible. This may be changed in a major release down the road but its what we're sticking with for now. <br />
 *
 * When using Containers there are a few guidelines we recommend: <br />
 * 1. If you need direct access to the memory stored, store a pointer. Keep it simple. <br />
 * 2. If you do not need direct access, store the raw type (e.g. for .?int\d+_t types) <br />
 * 3. Containers themselves should be passed by pointer. This consistency helps when the Container needs to be Cast, etc. <br />
