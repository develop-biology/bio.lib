/**
 * A Cache is a register of Cached objects. <br />
 * This class provides an easy to use interface for accessing cached variables. <br />
 * <br />
 * When to use: <br />
 * For the most part, you will never need to use *this directly. <br />
 * The one exception is if you are creating a save / load system and need to Clear the Cache after changing the underlying values. <br />
 * <br />
 * What to cache: <br />
 * The Biology library make heavy use of Name <-> Id pairings. Ids are faster; names are more robust. <br />
 * Any kind of speed trade off through pairing is a candidate for caching. <br />
