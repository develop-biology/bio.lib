/**
 * We use our own String implementation in order to ensure consistency across the library and to provide a single point of optimization for all String operations. <br />
 * We would like bio::Strings to encompass both the compile-time behavior of std::string_view and run-time versatility of std::string while being fully backwards compatible. <br />
 * <br />
 * Like other Biology classes, String is inheritable and designed to be extended. <br />
 * <br />
 * String is implemented as the addition of mutability to ImmutableString by way of a non-trivial destructor with the ability to allocate and delete data. <br />
 * ImmutableStrings can be used in constexpr while Strings cannot. <br />
 * <br />
 * Strings have different Modes. These Modes indicate how to handle internal operations. <br />
 * The Mode of a String is set depending on how it is constructed. <br />
 * You may change the String::Mode using the static SetMode method, which will produce a new String. <br />
 * A READ_ONLY String cannot be set by any means. If you wish to edit a READ_ONLY String, you must SetMode first. <br />
 * A COPY_ON_WRITE String will automatically become a READ_WRITE String when written to. <br />
 * NOTE: There are no "WRITE" operation for COPY_ON_WRITE to use. This will likely change in a future release. <br />
