 * Certain places in the bio framework afford easy toggling between storing fewer variables and calculating the values only when needed or caching the values and only calculating them once (or as necessary).
 * BIO_MEMORY_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL controls this tradeoff.
 * At a lower value, BIO_MEMORY_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL will cause more memory to be cached, saving cpu.
 * At a higher value, BIO_MEMORY_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL will cause less memory to be cached, costing cpu.
 * Values generally range from 0 to 1 (on or off, for the time being).
