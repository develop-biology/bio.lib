/**
 * ThreadSafe classes are ones that can potentially be called concurrently. <br />
 * They are meant to be simple and abstract. <br />
 * The actual interface of ThreadSafe methods is c++ version and platform specific. <br />
 * Fortunately, threading was standardized in c++11; however, we do still support c++98 builds. <br />
 * At this time, ThreadSafe methods are only implemented for c++11 and on and on linux systems using c++98 and on. <br />
 * Support for c++98 on other platforms may or may not ever happen. <br />
 *
 * NOTE: if you do not need threading and don't want to waste time locking & unlocking a single thread all the time, check out Optimize.h (in bio/common), which will let you turn off threading for an extra performance boost (i.e. set BIO_THREAD_ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL to 0 to disable). <br />
 *
 * Please see SafelyAccess for an easy way to create external locks of ThreadSafe classes.
