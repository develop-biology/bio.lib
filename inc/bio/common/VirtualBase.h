/**
 * NOTE: inheriting from VirtualBase is only necessary if your class will be virtually inherited and implements non-default constructors. <br />
 * <br />
 * C++ has a problem: virtually inherited classes are instantiated by the most derived class, bypassing all other initializers. Because we want our most derived classes to be simpler, not more complex, we either have to rely on a chaotic mesh of last-to-write setter calls in intermediate class constructors or do what we've done here. <br />
 * VirtualBase does 1 thing and that is to fix the problem above. Here's how we do this: <br />
 * First, the child class of VirtualBase (herein "TargetVirtualBase") should PROTECTEDLY and NOT VIRTUALLY inherit VirtualBase (i.e class MyClass : protected VirtualBase; Making MyClass the TargetVirtualBase which will be virtually inherited by other classes). <br />
 * Next, that TargetVirtualBase should implement InitializeImplementation(), taking each arg as if it were provided to the class constructor. <br />
 * Lastly, children of the TargetVirtualBase (which only protectedly inherits VirtualBase) should call TargetVirtualBase::Initialize(args), where ChildClass is the name of the class deriving from TargetVirtualBase, and args are all of the arguments necessary to initialize the TargetVirtualBase. <br />
 * NOTE: unlike normal c++ constructors, no args can be left out of the Initialize args list and both order and type must be perfectly aligned with what the child class expects. <br />
 * Unfortunately, because all this happens at run time, there are no compile-time type checks. <br />
 * <br />
 * When multiple child classes all call Initialize on a virtually inherited parent, only the FIRST call will take effect. All others will be ignored (but you can fall back on chaotic setter calls to overcome this). By inverting the way virtually inherited construction works, we can rely on passing arguments to a base class in order to construct a virtual base class, restoring normal derived->base initialization behavior. <br />
 * <br />
 * To illustrate how this works: <br />
 * [furthest derived class] ----> [virtual base default constructor] (implicit) <br />
 * [furthest derived class] ----> [parent class 1 constructor] ----> [grandparent 1 constructor] <br />
 * [furthest derived class] ----> [parent class 2 constructor] ----> [(virtual base)::Initialize()] <br />
 * [furthest derived class] ----> [parent class 3 constructor] ----> [(virtual base)::Initialize()] <br />
 * In this example, only "parent class 2" gets to Initialize the virtual base. <br />
 * "Parent class 3" does not get to Initialize the virtual base. <br />
 * "Furthest derived class" elects "parent class 2" as the Initializer based on it's inheritance order ("parent class 2" comes first). <br />
 * If we change up the order and have "grandparent 1" call Initialize, we'll have to make sure "parent class 1" passes the appropriate arguments to the "grandparent 1" constructor. <br />
 * Passing arguments to the Initializing parent is thus the key to making this system work without needing to have the "furthest derived class" include the virtual base in its initializer list. <br />
 * <br />
 * Some notes: <br />
 * 1. Derived classes CANNOT call Initialize if any of their parents have (i.e. those calls will fail). <br />
 * 2. Multiple calls to Initialize are allowed provided each one targets a unique and unambiguous VirtualBase derived class (i.e. you can combine VirtualBases). <br />
 * 3. ONLY virtually inherited classes should define InitializeImplementation. Because the method is virtual, it is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR if any children of the virtually inherited class override InitializeImplementation. However, such children may call the virtual parent's Initialize all they want.  <br />
 * 4. It is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR (because I don't know what will happen, not because it's wrong) to virtually derive from a virtual child of VirtualBase (i.e. try not to virtually inherit more than once, and if you do, tread carefully). <br />
