/**
 * BIO_SAFETY_LEVEL dictates how fast vs safe *this should be. <br />
 * A lower level means faster runtime and a higher chance of crashing. <br />
 * A higher level means slower runtime and a smaller chance of crashing. <br />
 * Values generally range from 0 to 3 (unless you make your own code dependent on the BIO_SAFETY_LEVEL). <br />
 * For BIO_SANITIZE, this means: <br />
 * 0. just run success, don't even check the condition; i.e. assume failure is not possible. <br />
 * 1. check the condition and run the provided failure if necessary; i.e. assume failure is not bad. <br />
 * 2. check the condition and throw an exception when failing; i.e. assume failure is fatal but recoverable if caught. <br />
 * 3. assert the condition is true and halt execution when failing; i.e. assume failure is fatal and cannot be recovered. <br />
 * NOTE: there are no catch statements in *this framework. <br />
 *
 * The default BIO_SAFETY_LEVEL is 3.

/**
 * Certain places in the bio framework afford easy toggling between storing fewer variables and calculating the values only when needed or caching the values and only calculating them once (or as necessary). <br />
 * BIO_MEMORY_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL controls this tradeoff. <br />
 * At a lower value, BIO_MEMORY_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL will cause more memory to be cached, saving cpu. <br />
 * At a higher value, BIO_MEMORY_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL will cause less memory to be cached, costing cpu. <br />
 * Values generally range from 0 to 1 (on or off, for the time being). <br />
