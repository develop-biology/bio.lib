/**
 * In C++, the "typedef" keyword does not create a distinct type, only an alias. Thus 2 identical typedefs of different names become merged into the same symbol at compile time. <br />
 * Here, we work around this bug by creating a wrapper class that does nothing but contain another value. <br />
 * When declaring a StrongTypedef, we also want to make sure the class is appropriately declared as Primitive (i.e. IsPrimitive< SomeStrongTypedef >() returns the appropriate value). <br />
 * NOTE: If using a C++ version below 14, this will be treated as Primitive (c++14 and above treats this as if it were the given type). If you desire behavior otherwise, either duplicate this code or selectively undef and redefine it. <br />
