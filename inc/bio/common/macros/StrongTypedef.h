/**
 * Another problem with C++: the "typedef" keyword does not create a distinct type, only an alias. Thus 2 identical typedefs of different names become merged into the same symbol at compile time. <br />
 *
 * Here, we work around this bug by creating a wrapper class that does nothing but contain another value. <br />
 * Unfortunately, operator type() alone is not sufficient to treat this new class as the type it holds and we must instead forward all operations to the contained type. <br />
 * ugh. <br />
 * If you know of a better solution to this problem, please make a pull request. <br />
 *
 * This wrapper is currently not virtual and cannot be inherited from. This may change in a future release. <br />
