/**
 * Singleton interface makes the constructor private so that there is only one instance ever created, which is by Instance() <br />
 * we also override default copy constructor and assignment operator so that nobody can make a copy of the singleton  (otherwise it wouldn't be a singleton). We don't define them, so these methods will give a link error if used. <br />
 * @param className the name of the new singleton
 * @param baseClass the name of the class the new singleton will inherit from (i.e. what to make into a singleton).
