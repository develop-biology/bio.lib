/**
 * BIO_SANITIZE evaluates the current BIO_SAFETY_LEVEL and performs the appropriate checks. <br />
 * A lower BIO_SAFETY_LEVEL will mean faster run speed but a higher chance of crashing. <br />
 * NOTE: "auto" in the examples below is only available after c++11 and should be substituted with the appropriate type. <br />
 *
 * This is basically (test) ? (success) : (failure) <br />
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Do not declare variables within any statement (test, success, & failure). <br />
 * Any variables declared will go out of scope and won't be accessible to you. <br />
 *
 * BIO_SANITIZE should be usable in the following ways (and the variations thereof): <br />
 * BIO_SANITIZE(some_test(), some_test()->do_something(), ) <br />
 * BIO_SANITIZE(myVar, myVar->do_something(), do_something_else()) <br />
 * auto myVar; BIO_SANITIZE(some_test(), myVar = some_test(), myVar = 0) <br />
 * auto myOtherVar; BIO_SANITIZE(myVar, myOtherVar = myVar->do_something(), myOtherVar = 0) <br />

/**
 * For more intensive tests, the result can be cached in a variable called RESULT of the given type. <br />
 *
 * You can access the cached result of TEST in the variable RESULT. <br />
 *               THIS CAN GO HORRIBLY WRONG!!!!! <br />
 * C++11 is safe and should throw compiler errors if you mess up but C++98 requires the use of a ByteStream hack around the auto keyword. This should be safe when using built in types and pointers but THE BEHAVIOR OF ANYTHING ELSE IS UNDEFINED. <br />

 * To make sure this is safe, do the following: <br />
 *     1. Make sure your success and/or failure expressions treat RESULT as the return type of your test expression. <br />
 *     2. Do not use a test expression that returns a non-basic type if you are using C++98. Pointers are okay. <br />
 *
 * The above examples can be rewritten as: <br />
 * BIO_SANITIZE_WITH_CACHE(some_test(), RESULT->do_something(), ); <br />
 * BIO_SANITIZE_WITH_CACHE(myVar, myVar->do_something(), do_something_else()); <br />
 * auto myVar; BIO_SANITIZE_WITH_CACHE(some_test(), myVar = RESULT, myVar = 0); <br />
 * auto myOtherVar; BIO_SANITIZE_WITH_CACHE(myVar, myOtherVar = myVar->do_something(), myOtherVar = 0); <br />
 *
 * Just as with BIO_SANITIZE, "auto" may only be used with c++11 or greater and should be replaced with the appropriate type. <br />
 * NOTE: when using myVar->methods(), we don't use RESULT so that any mutating (i.e. non-const) operations are applied to myVar and not lost when RESULT goes out of scope. <br />
