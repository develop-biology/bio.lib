 * BIO_SANITIZE evaluates the current BIO_SAFETY_LEVEL and performs the appropriate checks.

 * NOTE: "auto" in the examples below is only available after c++11 and should be substituted with the appropriate type.
 *
 * This is basically (test) ? (success) : (failure)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Do not declare variables within any statement (test, success, & failure).
 * Any variables declared will go out of scope and won't be accessible to you.

 * BIO_SANITIZE(some_test(), some_test()->do_something(), );
 * BIO_SANITIZE(myVar, myVar->do_something(), do_something_else());
 * auto myVar; BIO_SANITIZE(some_test(), myVar = some_test(), myVar = 0);

/**
 * For more intensive tests, the result can be cached in a variable called RESULT of the given type.
 *
 * You can access the cached result of TEST in the variable RESULT.
 *               THIS CAN GO HORRIBLY WRONG!!!!!
 * C++11 is safe and should throw compiler errors if you mess up but C++98 requires the use of a ByteStream hack around the auto keyword. This should be safe when using built in types and pointers but THE BEHAVIOR OF ANYTHING ELSE IS UNDEFINED.

 * To make sure this is safe, do the following:
 *     1. Make sure your success and/or failure expressions treat RESULT as the return type of your test expression.
 *     2. Do not use a test expression that returns a non-basic type if you are using C++98. Pointers are okay.
 *
 * The above examples can be rewritten as:
 * BIO_SANITIZE_WITH_CACHE(some_test(), RESULT->do_something(), );
 * BIO_SANITIZE_WITH_CACHE(myVar, myVar->do_something(), do_something_else());
 * auto myVar; BIO_SANITIZE_WITH_CACHE(some_test(), myVar = RESULT, myVar = 0);
 * auto myOtherVar; BIO_SANITIZE_WITH_CACHE(myVar, myOtherVar = myVar->do_something(), myOtherVar = 0);
 *
 * Just as with BIO_SANITIZE, "auto" may only be used with c++11 or greater and should be replaced with the appropriate type.
 * NOTE: when using myVar->methods(), we don't use RESULT so that any mutating (i.e. non-const) operations are applied to myVar and not lost when RESULT goes out of scope.
