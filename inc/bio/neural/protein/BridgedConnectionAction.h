/**
Bridged Synapse Proteins have access to both the Incoming and AxonProtein members.
These types of synapses are useful for implementing new synapse types that utilize the API of your custom Neuron type, but should also be flexible enough to accommodate any configuration of neurons you would like.
DO NOT USE THESE LIGHTLY!
Because you can pass data straight from the source to the target, it may be tempting to bypass the synapse system altogether. Don't do that. Meaning to say, be careful that the use of these proteins doesn't add in extra points of failure or bugs to your system.

NOTE: This class could be implemented by deriving from Incoming and AxonProteins. However, those classes would have to virtually inherit SynapseProtein, which causes c-style upcasts of classes that inherit from I/O SynapseProteins to fail when RTTI is disabled.
