/**
To make defining aspects easier, use this macro to define the function body of your Aspect Function().
This will assign a value to a string that is identical to your FunctionName e.g. AspectTracker::Instance().NameFromId(Value()) would give "Value"
Necessitates that functionName be a part of the "aspect" namespace and that any other namespaces are already specified (e.g. using namespace)
