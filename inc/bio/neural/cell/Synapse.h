/**
 * Synapses take data from one Neuron, the "presynapticNeuron", and make it available to another Neuron, the "postsynapticNeuron". <br />
 * Synapses are Cells. This is unusual. However, if we think of the proteins within the synaptic cleft as a specialized & distinct unit, this starts to make sense. The only major difference then is the lack of a membrane around the synaptic cleft. <br />
 * So, in our Biology framework, Synapses have their own Genes, Proteins, local Dissolved Substances, and can be specialized just like any other Cell. <br />
 * <br />
 * In order to remove data that was previously added while simultaneously allowing more data to be pushed through *this, a history of the data in *this must be kept. <br />
 * This history need only be a single value (i.e. not a complete history). <br />
 * The reason for this is that if a new datum is pushed through this that would overwrite data that has not been added, the previous, unadded data are no longer useful and can be freely overwritten. <br />
 * Similarly, if the old datum always represents what is currently added to to the postsynapticNeuron, there is no need to maintain a history of more than this single datum. <br />
 * For example a Synapse that passes a float might have: float mUnprocessed float mProcessed This type of 2 value system will be a common motif among bio::Synapses. The unprocessed, or "new", value is a value from the presynapticNeuron that has not yet been added  to the postsynapticNeuron. Once this value is added, it becomes processed, or "old". <br />
 * In general, Synapses look like: [SOURCE]----[*this]---->[TARGET] <br />
 * When sending data, [SOURCE]-->ProcessOutgoing()-->Update() [SOURCE]-->DepotentiateSignal() (totally optional) <br />
 * When receiving data, ProcessPotentiation()-->[TARGET] (postsynapticNeuron calls ProcessPotentiation, which affects ProcessDepotentiation()-->[TARGET] the postsynapticNeuron in some way) <br />
 * <br />
 * NOTE: Creating synapses outside of Neuron::ConnectTo(...) is not supported. <br />
 * <br />
 * To use *this between any pair of neurons, use ConfigureFor() (below). <br />
