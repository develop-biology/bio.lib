/**
Synapses take data from one neuron, the "source", and make it available to another neuron, the "target".
In order to remove data that was previously added while simultaneously allowing more data to be pushed through *this, a history of the data in *this must be kept.
This history need only be a single value.
The reason for this is that if a new datum is pushed through this that would overwrite data that has not been added, the previous, unadded data are no longer useful and can be freely overwritten.
Similarly, if the old datum always represents what is currently added to to the target, there is no need to maintain a history of more than this single datum.
For example a Synapse that passes a float might have: float m_unprocessed float m_processed This type of 2 value system will be a common motif among bio::Synapses. The unprocessed, or "new", value is a value from the source that has not yet been added to the target. Once this value is added, it becomes processed, or "old".
In general, Synapses look like: [SOURCE]----[*this]---->[TARGET]
When sending data, [SOURCE]-->ProcessOutgoing()-->Update() [SOURCE]-->ExpireSignal() (totally optional)
When receiving data, ProcessAddition()-->[TARGET] (target calls ProcessAddition, which affects ProcessRemoval()-->[TARGET] the target in some way)
