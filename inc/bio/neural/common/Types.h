Synapses are stored in the Brain and applied to neurons.
There can be up to 65535 different kinds of synapses.
NOTE: that this does not prevent you from configuring a synapse after it has been created (e.g. adding a epitope from one synapse to another). However, it is better practice to configure all synapses before they are used.
