/**
 * chemical::Symmetry adds a recursive structure to physical::Symmetry. This enables nesting and complex structures to form. <br />
 * Primarily, chemical::Symmetry allows for lists (chemical::Structures) and basic operations (chemical::Reactions) to be Rotated. <br />
 * <br />
 * All chemical::Symmetries have a Miscibility which determines how multiple Symmetries are Mixed. <br />
 * Mixing operates on Symmetries in order to provide a standard means of combining Biological objects. <br />
 * The default Miscibility is Passthrough(), which will cause all nested Symmetries to be Realized. <br />
 * To avoid superfluous updates when Realizing a highly-nested object, Symmetries will, by default, be non-recursive. This means that Reifying a Wave with *this should only update the Wave's initial value, and not check the nested Symmetries within this (e.g. not update member variables or sub-objects of the Wave*). <br />
 * There are 3 ways to enable recursive behavior: <br />
 * 1. Set the Miscibility to Passthrough(), this will cause all nested Symmetries (which are not themselves Passthrough Miscible) to be updated, but no more than that. <br />
 * 2. Set the mRealization of *this to NULL. This will enable full Reification on the first call only. After *this has been Reified, it will have a mRealization and will not seek to be fully Reified again unless otherwise specified. <br />
 * 3. Add the state::Recursive(). This can be done with the ease-of-use method: Recurse(). <br />
