/**
 * A chemical::Reaction takes in Reactants and produces Products, performing some work in between.
 * This is basically a fancy functor that takes advantage of Atom::Bonds and Substance Properties and States to do argument validation.
 *
 * To make a Reaction, you must overload Process (virtual chemical::Products Process(chemical::Substances& reactants) = 0;)
 * Then, preferably in your ctor, state the Require()ments.
 * Each Require()d Reactant* will be checked against the reactants (Substances&) provided to *this.
 * ORDER MATTERS! The reactants must follow the same order as the Required Reactants!
 *
 * To invoke a Reaction, use the operator(), providing reactants.
 * For example: MyReaction r; r(MyReactants);
 * Doing so will do all necessary input checking and then call Process(), if all is good. Otherwise no Products are returned and you will get a code::code::FailedReaction().
 *
 * Other ways to invoke a reaction include:
 * Reaction::Attempt<MyReaction>(MyReactants)
 * ForEach<MyReactant>(Reaction::Initiate<MyReaction>()) (see LinearStructuralComponent.h)
 *
