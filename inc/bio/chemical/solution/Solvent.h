/**
 * Solvents contain Solutes and embody the idea of context. <br />
 * Solvents and Structural Motifs define 2 points in a continuum of organization: Structural Motifs are highly ordered and predictable while Solvents are dynamic and "chaotic". The remainder of this continuum is populated by the usages of these 2 classes. <br />
 * The main difference between Solvents and Structural Motifs is that multiple Solvents cannot exist in the same context. Because Solvents represent context, combining 2 Solvents simply yields a novel context, i.e. a singular Solvent. On the other hand, multiple Structures can be easily separated after being combined. <br />
 * Another notable difference between Solvents and Structural Motifs is that Structures can be formed of many different components, while Solvents are only comprised of Solutes; if you would like to add something to a Solvent, it must be a Solute.
 * <br />
 * Solutes are essentially shared pointers which track their reference count via their Concentration. <br />
 * Diffusing Solutes to other Solvents allows the variables in *this to be accessed from other "contexts". <br />
 * When const Diffusing (i.e. read-only), only the Concentration of the Solute is increased. <br />
 * When non-const Diffusing (i.e. read-write) to a Solvent other than *this, the Solute is Cloned and passed to the writer. <br />
 * This system provides traditional member access while simultaneously ensuring multiple conflicting writes from external sources never produce a conflict. The entire point of the Circulatory system is to merge these multiple Solutes back into one. <br />
 * NOTE that this style of "Concentration goes up on access" is the inverse of real life. In the real world, "access", as quantified by binding affinity and reaction rate, is limited by a solute's concentration. We find this inversion to be more in line with state machine linear access semantics but may enforce a ConcentrationLimit or similar mechanism in a future release. <br />
 * <br />
 * In real-world chemistry, the notation "[chemical]" is used to indicate the concentration of "chemical" in some solvent. We imitate that here with the [] operator, the only difference is that the caller must specify which Solvent they are talking about and the return is not the Concentration but the Solute itself. <br />
 * For example, Cytoplasm["Glucose"] would give the Glucose Solute within the Cytoplasm Solvent (its Concentration is irrelevant for our purposes). <br />
 * <br />
 * Solvents are their own Perspectives to allow for easy identification of their contents: "VariableA" in "Solvent1" can have Id 3, while "VariableA" in "Solvent2" can have Id 234687. Because Solutes are not identified through a global Perspective, we can use Diffuse(Name ...) calls, etc. (consider if they were identified globally and we store a child of Solute which is Identifiable through a different Perspective than that of the other Solutes we store). <br />
