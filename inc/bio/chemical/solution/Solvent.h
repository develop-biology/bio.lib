/**
 * Solvents contain Solutes and embody the idea of context. <br />
 * This system provides traditional member access while simultaneously ensuring multiple conflicting writes from external sources never produce a conflict. <br />
 * <br />
 * Solvents closely model physical::Lines & structural Motifs, but are intended to be more user facing and have a slightly different features.
 * The main difference between Solvents and structural Motifs is that multiple Solvents cannot exist in the same context. Because Solvents represent context, combining 2 Solvents simply yields a novel context, i.e. a singular Solvent. On the other hand, multiple Structures can be easily separated after being combined. With that said, Solvents can be nested (e.g. through Vesicles). <br />
 * Another notable difference between Solvents and structural Motifs is that Structures can be formed of many different components, while Solvents are only comprised of Solutes; if you would like to add something to a Solvent, it must be a Solute (i.e. a Dissolved Substance).
 * <br />
 * Solvents and structural Motifs define 2 points in a continuum of organization: Structural Motifs are highly ordered and predictable (i.e. they have a preset type) while Solvents are dynamic and more "chaotic" (i.e. any Substance can be Dissolved in them). The remainder of this continuum is populated by the usages of these 2 classes. <br />
 * <br />
 * Solutes themselves are essentially shared pointers which track their reference count via their Concentration. <br />
 * Egressing a Solute to other Solvents increases the Concentration of the Solute and allows its Substance to be accessed from other "contexts". <br />
 * Solutes can be Egressed as const for read-only access or as non-const for read-write access. <br />
 * <br />
 * This style of "Concentration goes up on access" is the inverse of real life. In the real world, "access", as quantified by binding affinity and reaction rate, is limited by a solute's concentration. We find this inversion to be more in line with state machine linear access semantics but may enforce a ConcentrationLimit or similar mechanism in a future release. <br />
 * <br />
 * In real-world chemistry, the notation "[chemical]" is used to indicate the concentration of "chemical" in some solvent. However, Concentration is mostly irrelevant for access purposes and is thus ignored. You may access the ByteStream representation of a Solute with [Index || SmartIterator] or the Solute itself with [Id || Name].<br />
 * <br />
 * Solvents rely on the IdPerspective to map their contents (all Solutes are Identifiable<Id>). <br />
