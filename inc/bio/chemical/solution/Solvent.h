/**
 * Solvents contain Solutes. That is all.
 * NOTE: in real-world chemistry, [chemical] gives the concentration of "chemical" in some solvent. We replicate that here with the [] operator, the only difference is that the caller must specify which Solvent they are talking about.
 * For example, Cytoplasm["Glucose"] would give the Concentration of the Glucose Solute within the Cytoplasm Solvent.
 * This is close to what you should expect from a programming view point, where [] is the "index of" operator: Cytoplasm["Glucose"] is the same as Cytoplasm->GetByName< Solute* >("Glucose")->GetConcentration().
 * NOTE: Solutes need to have Periodic::CheckIn()s. Solvents do not do that. See circulatory::Vessel for that.
