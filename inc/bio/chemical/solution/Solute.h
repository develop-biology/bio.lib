/**
 * Solutes mimic the effect of small molecules, hormones, etc. on overall behavior.
 * These are, in effect, global variables which effect system wide changes.
 * As an example, let's look at hunger. A "Hunger" Solute (e.g. "Ghrelin") may increase over time and be decreased by a "Food" or "Digestion" stimulus.
 * The term "Concentration" denotes the strength of the chemical signal, i.e. the value of the global variable.
 * We also have a min and max to describe this Organism's chemical limits and abstract away complex metabolic regulation.
 * "Fluctuations" allow a Solute's Concentration to be changed over time or in response to a stimulus.
 *
 * Solutes are Substances but are not Molecules, they only affect systems through their concentration, not their particular shape.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CLASS DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ROUNDING ERRORS!
 * If you start at 0.0f and then increment and decrement this class by the same value, do not expect the result to be 0.0f!
