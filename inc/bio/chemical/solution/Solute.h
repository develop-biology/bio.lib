/**
 * Solutes are used to implement shared-pointer style garbage collection. <br />
 * The idea is that Solutes have a "Concentration" representing their overall abundance. Once the Concentration of a Solute drops to 0, it is destroyed. <br />
 * The Concentration of a Solute is increased when it becomes available to a novel context (i.e. Solution) through Solution::Efflux (e.g. passed to a function). <br />
 * <br />
 * Solute is very similar to physical::Linear. However, it is intended to be more user-facing and feature-rich. Where Linear is used to implement shared pointers for Structures, Solute implements shared pointer logic for Solutions.
 * See Solution.h for more info, including the definition of Efflux and Influx. <br />
 * <br />
 * Solutes can be accessed (Effluxed) in 2 distinct manners. Both manners of Effluxing increase the Concentration of the desired Solute.<br />
 * 1. When const (read-only) Effluxing, Solutes use a parent-child relationship: only the parent will contain a valid pointer to the Dissolved Substance, each child then points to the parent. This is slower across threads, as each read operation requires a lock, but is faster overall, since the Dissolved Substance doesn't need to be duplicated.<br />
 * 2. When non-const (read-write & mutable) Effluxing, the Dissolved Substance is Cloned and a parent-child relationship is only used to indicate the source Substance. This style of Effluxing can be chained, and the Concentration will increase all the way up to the original Source. You should prefer mutable access across threads, as the Cloned Substance can be modified more freely, without the need for mutex locks. When you would like to merge the new Solute back into the original Solution, you can Diffuse it, which will call Influx on the parent's Solution.<br />
 * <br />
 * For mutable Solutes, Diffusion happens automatically when the Solute is destroyed, unless you set SetDiffusionTime(diffusion::time::Never()). You may also set SetDiffusionTime(diffusion::time::Interval()) and SetInterval(...) to regularly Diffuse (this implies diffusion::time::Destruction() too). <br />
 * The default diffusion::effort is Active(), whereby changes are pushed up the Concentration gradient, toward the source of the Dissolved Substance. However, parents of mutable Solutes can push changes to children using SetDiffusionEffort(diffusion::effort::Passive()) (or ActiveAndPassive()). Passive() Diffusion is only applicable to Solutes which have a diffusion::time::Interval(). <br />
 * You should prefer Active() Diffusion for Solutes with short lifetimes, as it is more efficient and requires less work. Inversely, you should prefer Passive() Diffusion for Solutes that you intend to keep around; this will help keep the system in sync. <br />
 * <br />
 * When Solutes are Mixed, either through Diffusion or Influxion, they are combined according to their Miscibilities. <br />
 * See Types.h & Miscibility.h for more info on Mixing strategies. <br />
 * <br />
 * To illustrate why parent Concentrations are increased when mutable Solutes are Effluxed:, if function A uses Solute U1 from Solution V1 and function B also uses U1, even if each function exists in an isolated sub-Solution of V1, both functions will start with the same value. Furthermore, if B depends on modifications to U1 made by A, then having U1 be removed from V1 after A completes would break B. <br />
 * Thus, by keeping Solutes around when they are not needed by the immediate context allows sub-contexts to depend on the assumption that other, isolated sub-contexts can reach the same values. <br />
