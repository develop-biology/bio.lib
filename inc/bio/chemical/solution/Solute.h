/**
 * Solutes are used to implement shared-pointer style garbage collection. <br />
 * The idea is that Solutes have a "Concentration" representing their overall abundance. Once the Concentration of a Solute drops to 0, it is destroyed. <br />
 * The Concentration of a Solute is increased when it becomes available to a novel context through Solvent::Diffuse (e.g. passed to a function). <br />
 * Solutes are cloned when non-const Diffusing; while const access to a Solute simply increases its Concentration. <br />
 * See Solvent.h for more info on how Diffusion works. <br />
 * <br />
 * When a Solute's Concentration reaches 0, before it is destroyed, it automatically lets its parent Solvent know that it is no longer needed. <br />
 * For example, if Solvent V2 gets Solute U2 by cloning Solute U1 from Solvent V1, the originating Solute U1 will have its Concentration increased while U2 exists. Once U2 is removed from V2, the Concentration of U1 (in V1) will drop. <br />
 * This process ensures that Solutes persist in greater contexts while in use by sub-contexts, and makes it possible for isolated sub-contexts to communicate through their common greater context. <br />
 * For example, if function A uses Solute U1 from Solvent V1 and function B also uses U1, even if each function exists in an isolated sub-Solvent of V1, both functions will start with the same value. Furthermore, if B depends on modifications to U1 made by A, then having U1 be removed from V1 after A completes would break B. <br />
 * Thus, by keeping Solutes around when they are not needed by the immediate context allows sub-contexts to depend on the assumption that other, isolated sub-contexts can reach the same values. <br />
 * <br />
 * Additionally, when a Solute's Concentration reaches 0 and before it's destroyed, it is Dissolved back into its parent Solvent according to the Miscibility of its parent Solute. This allows sub-contexts to affect greater contexts and thus cooperate with neighboring, isolated contexts. <br />
