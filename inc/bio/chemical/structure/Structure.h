 * Chemical structures can have Motifs.
 * Here, we implement all the necessary interfaces for adding Motifs to your classes.
 *
 * This class should be virtually inherited.
 *
 * Motifs should be inherited (but can be added through Bonding). The reason that we break the "has a motif" idea and instead go for "is a motif" inheritance style is that chemical compositions define the identity of chemical structures. So if a chemical substance would change its identity by containing different motifs, it makes sense that the motifs define the class structure of the substance.
