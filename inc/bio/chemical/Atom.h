/**
 * Atom MUST be virtually inherited!
 * Atom is an interface for other implementations.
 * Atom objects form Bonds with Waves (such as Quantum Waves, like real-life electrons). Counter to how atoms are often described, here, you can Bond things that are not Atoms (iff they are a Wave). This is similar to forming ionic bonds or radicals where the "bonded" target is a sub-atomic particle (also a shared resource).
 * Waves have a unique class name to Id mapping that is stored in the PeriodicTable. Atom objects take advantage of this to store and retrieve pointers to any type.
 * Bonds are arbitrarily flexible, so this system can be (ab)used in many ways.
 * Unlike real chemistry, the actual valence of a Atom changes to accommodate new Bonds.
 * NOTE: m_bonds[0] is always empty. This may change in a future release.
