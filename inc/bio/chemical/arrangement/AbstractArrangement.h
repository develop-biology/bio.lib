/**
 * AbstractArrangement exists as a base class to templated Arrangements.
 * Essentially we need a generic, non-template std::vector<> base class, so we'll make our own.
 *
 * Arrangements create Structure.
 *
 * You can think of Arrangements as our own internal RAM.
 *
 * When using Arrangements, we make no guarantees regarding the type of data stored. All we provide is a consistent means of accessing those data. To this end, we ensure that a Position's validity follows the lifecycle of the datum at that Position. This is identical to pointers: a Position represents the memory address of what is stored in *this. This means that as data are erased from *this, the memory is not moved, consolidated, or manipulated in any way that destroys the old references.
 *
 * When using an Iterator, you will be given a SmartIterator which dynamically determines its implementation. Thus, we allow for full inheritance of *this base class.
 *
 * There is another tradeoff here that we are leaning into: our implementation does not make for easy use of std:: containers under-the-hood. By enforcing consistency on access, we've made the system less flexible. This may be changed in a major release down the road but its what we're sticking with for now.
