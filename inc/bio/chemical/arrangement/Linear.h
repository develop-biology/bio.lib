/**
 * Linear is a ____pointer implementation for Biology.
 *
 * This class is used by LinearStructuralComponents, see that class for more info.
 *
 * The term "linear" comes from the idea that instead of a 0 dimensional pile of types, as are StructuralComponents, *this can be ordered along at least 1 dimension (i.e. the StandardDimension). In other words, LinearStructuralComponents contain logic for handling their CONTENT_TYPE by Id, Name, and other aspects innate to the physical::Identifiable<StandardDimension>.
 *
 * Current features:
 * 1. Shared: determines whether or not m_component will be deleted with *this.
 *
 * Future features:
 * 1. Const: determines whether or not *this can be changed.
 *
 * NOTE: Linear is NOT VIRTUAL!
 * This is done to save space in lists. Because we do not need a vtable, we shan't have one!
 *
 * NOTE: we should support Dimensions other than the StandardDimension. However, the limitations of Atom::Bonds prevent us from indexing more than 1 template variable from the ____Interface.
 * StandardDimension here, mirrors what is used by chemical::Class and does not require any additional template specialization.
 * Plus, not supporting other Dimensions makes for cleaner inheritance / downstream code.
 * Support for other Dimensions may be added in a future release.
