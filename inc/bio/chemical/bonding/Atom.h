/**
 * Atom MUST be virtually inherited! <br />
 * Atom is an interface for other implementations. <br />
 * Atom objects form Bonds with Waves (such as Quantum Waves, like real-life electrons). Counter to how atoms are often described, here, you can Bond things that are not Atoms (iff they are a Wave). This is similar to forming ionic bonds or radicals where the "bonded" target is a sub-atomic particle (also a shared resource). <br />
 * Waves have a unique class name to Id mapping that is stored in the PeriodicTable. Atom objects take advantage of this to store and retrieve pointers to any type. <br />
 * Bonds are arbitrarily flexible, so this system can be (ab)used in many ways. <br />
 * Unlike real chemistry, the actual valence of a Atom changes to accommodate new Bonds. <br />
 * NOTE: mBonds[0] is always empty. This may change in a future release. <br />
 *
 * NOTE: iff using a C++ version below 14, only Quantum<> Bonds are supported. This is due to an inability to evaluate IsPrimitive<>() expressions at compile time and the compiler following all "possible" execution paths, which are necessarily incompatible. <br />
