/**
 * Metallic bonds create a "horizontal inheritance" similar to Covalent bonds. <br />
 * With Metallic bonds, all Bonds are shared between the Bonding objects. <br />
 * This solves the problem of Bonding a child class but trying to use As< ParentClass >(). <br />
 * However, this introduces the limitation of not being able to Bond more than one object of the same type. <br />
 * If both of the objects being Bonded have already Bonded to an object of the same type, the behavior is undefined (ideally neither class is affected & the result of As< SharedClass >() depends on which object you start with. <br />
 * When instantiating a Metallic class, a new T will be created and Metallicly bonded to the child class of *this (through the shared Atom). <br />
 * Each Metallic Bond has a distinct Type based on the template it is constructed with. This type helps to identify which Bonds have been shared. <br />
 * You may get the BondType *this uses with GetBondType(). <br />
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: Metallic Bonds are only updated when a new Metallic Bond is created. <br />
 * NOTE: atm, there is no way to provide arguments to the new Ts. <br />
 * See Atom.h for more on Bonds.<br />
