 * Vasculature is a Tissue which contains all linked BloodVessels. <br />

 * You may have multiple Vasculatures in the same way you may have multiple Hearts. Doing so will create distinct regions of synchronicity in your Organism. For example, if your Organism models a population of bacteria, each bacterium could have its own Vasculature and interact with its environment in a manner disparate from its neighbors. <br />
