/**
Personality: Holds all the circulatory variables
API Personality variables are created by the the circulatory file. See documentation below in the ctor. GetValue(string) Returns current value of circulatory variable "string". SetValue(string) Sets current value of circulatory variable "string". ChangeViaStimulus() Call to increment circulatory variable by a stimulus defined in the circulatory JSON file. StartChangeViaTimeRate() Call to start changing circulatory variable by   time rate defined in the circulatory JSON file.  StopChangeViaTimeRate()     Call to stop changing circulatory variable by the     time rate defined in StartChangeViaTimeRate(). Poll() is to be called by Brain or other fast clock
