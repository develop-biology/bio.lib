/**
 * A Writer is a base class for any other object that can write to a log engine. <br />
 * The reason for Writer to be a base class, rather than using a singleton log engine is that some objects may wish to write logs to different files than others or, perhaps some logs should be seen only in console output while others should be saved to a file. <br />
 * This also allows an easy drop-in replacement of log::Engine for specific platforms and apps. <br />
 * The above is accomplished by passing log::Engine as a pointer to all LoggerObjects. <br />
